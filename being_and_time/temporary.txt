Metaphysics
- ontotheology
- question of the Being of beings

question of Being as such
- how does the object generalise from 

Alitia [some greek word] - > Veritas
- Was mistranslated as Truth, it is not the fact
- Is how the fact comes into being, the unconcealing
- it is not the established fact, but the continous process of unconcealing
as there is never a fully unconcealed fact

What is time? It is a product of motion. - Aristotle
- as a result, human beings are in time

We are time - St. Augustine
- he doesn't proceed furthur due to his attachment to eternity
- eternity is the simulteneous constant of the present, the copresence of all things at a point in time.
- eternity is the opposite of time

beings = time > eternity

Aristotle is wrong, - Hemri Bergson
- The unfolding of things (the true flow of time) -> objective time
- Inner time (the human perception of time) -> subjective time

Anything that lives, lives in the inner time.

Unlike what Bergson thought, time is a projection of the future on the present ond the past.
- animals don't experience the change of the present and past since they don't have context based on the future

Heidinnger does not believe in the eternity and believes it does not really exist.

So the question arises, who is time?
Dazein - Existence to Kant, but to heidengger, it does not refer to a "da", but a general appearence or "da".
A State, being in relation with a larger context.
"Dazein is its openess, its ability to reveal" - 133
"Dazein doesn't have the same being as an object, it is active and it has a world" - 143
- Dazein is not something present at hand, like an object

Befindlichkeit 
To find yourself, the situation in which someone finds themselves

Dazein always has a befindlichkeit, but is not confined to it. 

The zein does the da. page 42, note c.
